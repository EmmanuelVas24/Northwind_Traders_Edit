In this project, I have added new tables, procedures, and views to the Northwind Traders Database. Here is how the project is structured.

Northwind_createDB.sql
This file was used to create the database.

Card_Transaction_Tables.sql:
Two new tables are added to the database. 'Card' provides information about credit cards that are used by customers to make purchases. 'Transactions' refers to each purchase made by every user. The tables were populated by using stored procedures and inner joins with other tables. New views and procedures are made to get more information about transactions from the database.
